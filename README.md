# Metro_Operating_System
Simple version of an operating system that can be used in Metro Transportation,
The best way for you to understand operating systems concepts is to build an operating
system and then to experiment with it. Your OS will be a SIMULATION only. Your job
will be to choose the type of OS you want implement; define its different features and
functionality and implement them by the end of the semester. We expect that you will
eventually be creative and propose new or improved features and functionality.
